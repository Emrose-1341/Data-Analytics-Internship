## Technical Notes

**Sample Characteristics:**
- Total baseline sample: 13 youth outcomes analyzed
- Data represents None youth from 2020 NYTD cohort
- Follow-up data combines responses from ages 19 and 21 surveys

**Column Definitions:**
- **Baseline (Age 17):** Percentage experiencing outcome while in foster care at age 17
- **Post-Transition (Ages 19-21):** Percentage experiencing outcome at ages 19 and/or 21 (combined data)
- **Combined:** Percentage who experienced the outcome at any point during the study period

**Limitations:**
- Follow-up data may not be representative of all youth due to response patterns
- Some outcomes are only measured post-transition (e.g., public assistance for non-foster youth)
- "Ever experienced" data provides cumulative perspective but may not reflect current status
- Results reflect experiences during specific time periods and may not represent current conditions

**Data Quality:**
- Analysis includes all available data points for 2020 cohort
- Missing data patterns may affect representativeness of findings
- Cross-domain patterns should be interpreted as associations, not causal relationships
