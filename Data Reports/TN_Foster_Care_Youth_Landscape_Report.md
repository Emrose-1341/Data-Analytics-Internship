| **2** | Action required (interfering with functioning) |
| **3** | Dangerous/disabled requiring immediate action |

### **Analytic Approach**
- **Individual-level vulnerability scoring** for each domain
- **Geographic aggregation** at county and zip code levels  
- **Cross-domain correlation analysis** to identify patterns
- **High-need area identification** for resource prioritization

## **9. Conclusion**

The Tennessee foster care youth landscape reveals a complex picture of geographic disparities and vulnerability patterns across three critical domains. While the state shows moderate overall vulnerability levels, significant geographic variations exist that require targeted intervention strategies.

### **9.1 Key Insights**
- **Supportive Adult Relationships** represents the highest vulnerability area statewide
- **Rural counties** face unique challenges with limited service access
- **Urban counties** show better resource utilization and lower vulnerability
- **Geographic clustering** of vulnerability suggests regional intervention opportunities

### **9.2 Strategic Priorities**
1. **Immediate intervention** in high-need counties (Lake, Marion, Crockett)
2. **Enhanced service delivery** in rural and border counties
3. **Integrated case management** for youth with multiple vulnerabilities
4. **Prevention programs** targeting transition-age youth

### **9.3 Moving Forward**
This landscape analysis provides a foundation for evidence-based policy development and resource allocation. Continued monitoring and analysis will be essential to track progress and identify emerging needs across Tennessee's diverse geographic regions.

The data demonstrates that while challenges exist across all three focus areas, targeted interventions based on geographic vulnerability patterns can significantly improve outcomes for Tennessee's foster care youth population.
