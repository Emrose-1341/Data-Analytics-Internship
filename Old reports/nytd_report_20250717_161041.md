## A Pre-Post Analysis of Tennessee Foster Care Youth Using NYTD Data

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines 2 key outcomes for Tennessee foster care youth, combining data from multiple NYTD cohorts (FY11, FY14, FY17, and FY20). The data reveals significant variation in post-transition experiences, with 0 outcomes showing improvement, 0 showing decline, and 0 remaining stable.

The overall pattern suggests that while some domains show positive development (particularly employment), others reveal the ongoing challenges youth face in achieving stability after leaving foster care. Average baseline outcomes were 0.0%, compared to 0.0% post-transition, representing an overall change of +0.0 percentage points.

## Methodology

**Data Source:** National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Outcomes Survey  
**Population:** Tennessee foster care youth from merged NYTD cohorts  
**Timeframe:** 
- **Baseline (Wave 1):** Age 17 while in foster care
- **Post-Transition (Waves 2 & 3):** Ages 19 and 21 combined

**Analysis Note:** Post-transition outcomes combine responses from both 2-year and 4-year follow-up surveys to provide a comprehensive view of outcomes after leaving foster care. Data are pooled across multiple cohorts to increase sample size and generalizability.

## Technical Notes

**Sample Characteristics:**
- Total outcomes analyzed: 2 
- Data represents Tennessee youth from merged NYTD cohorts
- Column structure: baseline data from *_w1 columns, post-transition from *_w23 columns

**Column Definitions:**
- **Baseline (Age 17):** Percentage experiencing outcome while in foster care at age 17
- **Post-Transition (Ages 19-21):** Percentage experiencing outcome at ages 19 and/or 21 (combined data)

**Limitations:**
- Follow-up data may not be representative of all youth due to response patterns
- Some outcomes are only measured post-transition (e.g., public assistance for non-foster youth)
- Results reflect experiences during specific time periods and may not represent current conditions

**Data Quality:**
- Analysis includes all available data points from merged NYTD dataset
- Missing data patterns may affect representativeness of findings
- Cross-domain patterns should be interpreted as associations, not causal relationships
